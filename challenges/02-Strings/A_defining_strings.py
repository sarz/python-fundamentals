# Here we'll just set up some basic strings

# Strings go in quotes, but be careful about quotes in strings!
## You can see that you can create problems when you use a quote character in the
## string. There are a couple ways around this, including putting a backslash
## before the problematic quote, or using a different quote (")
print "This person's name will be defined very well!"

# Define your name
your_first_name = "Sarah"
your_last_name = "Ismail"
## Define strings called your_first_name and your_last_name (they can be
## anything)



print your_first_name, your_last_name, 'was here!'

# Your strings are sequences (of characters)
## Use subscripting to pull out the second character of your last name.
## Subscripting with a single number grabs the item right after that location:

##  +---+---+---+---+---+
##  | H | e | l | p | A |
##  +---+---+---+---+---+
##  0   1   2   3   4   5
## -5  -4  -3  -2  -1

## So, if s = 'HelpA', s[3] is 'p'. Don't forget that we start with 0 (no
## distance into the string).

print 'The second letter of my last name is', your_last_name[1]
